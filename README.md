- 👋 Hi, I’m Kamon.
- 👀 I’m a creative front-end developer gravitated towards all things automotive, design, basketball, and travel.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills into Node.JS and React.
- 🌍 I’d love to collaborate on open-source projects that contribute to the greater good of our world. As well as projects that reflect my personal interests.
