- 👋 Hi, I’m Kamon.
- 👀 I’m a creative front-end developer gravitated towards all things automotive, design, and travel.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in Node.JS and into React.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on open-source projects that contribute to the greater good of our world. As well as projects that reflect my personal interests.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can often identify the make, model, and specs of a vehicle just by looking at the rear profile.
