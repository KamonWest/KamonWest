- 👋 Hi, I’m Kamon.
- 👀 I’m a creative front-end developer interested in all things automotive, graphic design, basketball, boxing, and travel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reactJS.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on open-source projects to contribute to the greater good of our world. As well as projects that reflect my personal interests.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a sharp eye for vehicles and can often identify the make, model, and specs just by looking at the rear profile.
